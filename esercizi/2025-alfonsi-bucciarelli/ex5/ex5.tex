Compare briefly the different search strategies going from the first to the last, paying attention to the following points:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How slowly/quickly they explore better solutions. \\
    \textbf{def}: The default MiniZinc search performs poorly on this problem, finding few solutions and experiencing many failures, with the best solution it does find being worse than those found by other methods. This is likely due to its lack of restarts. However, even without restarts, the dWd-rand strategy outperforms the default search in both the number and quality of solutions found\\
    \textbf{dWd-rand}: This approach, while yielding the most solutions (tied with another method), also resulted in the most failures among those tested. This high number of solutions is attributed to the absence of a restart heuristic, allowing the search to explore very deep within the search tree. This exhaustive search, driven by the dWd (dynamic Width and depth) method's propagation and search space reduction, avoids prematurely abandoning potential solutions. However, the lack of restarts in the dWd-rand variant leads to excessive time spent exploring these deep branches, ultimately contributing to the increased failure rate due to the unlimited search depth. Subsequent models show improved failure rates
    \\
    \textbf{dWd-rand + restart}: This method experiences significantly fewer failures than the dWd-rand approach, but more than the previous LNS experiment. While restarting limits the number of solutions found compared to dWd-rand by pruning deeper branches of the search tree, it increases the likelihood of finding solutions closer to the optimal value by exploring a wider range of possibilities. This restarting strategy also improves robustness and reduces failures by preventing the search from becoming trapped in unproductive areas
    \\
    \textbf{dWd-rand + restart + Ins}: This strategy stands out as the top performer in terms of minimizing failures and achieving the best objective value, and it also finds a near-optimal number of solutions. Its only weakness is finding fewer solutions than some other methods. This success is largely due to Large Neighborhood Search (LNS), which breaks the problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems. Fixing variables within these subproblems shrinks their size and enhances constraint propagation, which is particularly effective in small domains. LNS significantly improves solution quality by efficiently exploring the neighborhood of existing solutions. By relaxing constraints on previously found solutions, LNS, combined with the efficient exploration capabilities of Constraint Programming (CP), quickly identifies improved solutions, leading to the observed speed and improved statistical results
    \item Does any search strategy (s1) return a better solution than another s2, while having more failures than s2? What could be the reason? \\
    Our primary search strategy (dWd) is compared to a standard search method (default search). dWd uses a "fail-first" approach, resulting in more failed attempts than the standard method. However, dWd's dynamic search strategy leads to finding more solutions overall, as it guides the search more effectively. The inherent linearity and symmetry of the N-queens problem may influence how randomization affects the search, contributing to the increased failures observed with dWd.
